### The First Gathering of Nova Spatial Labs, a VisionPro User Group (3/1/24)

Welcome to the Nova Spatial Labs 1st Meetup Gathering! Enjoy a change to meet fellow early adopters, and those who plan to buy one soon. We will be sharing our experiences, including success stories, and hopefully learn something new.

Please bring your own Apple Vision Pro if you have one. We will have an Wifi Network, and plan to demonstrate different VisionOS Apps. This may be the first time you can work with others in a Virtual share space using your Persona avatar.

Due to the sign in process at the Leidos Annex, reservations are required! We will not be able to have you just drop by. Please email your contact information to Steve Sheets (magesteve@mac.com).
